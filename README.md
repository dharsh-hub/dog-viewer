üê∂ Doggo Viewer
Doggo Viewer is a simple, multi-page website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Dog CEO API to display random dog images filtered by breed. This project was developed as part of an API integration assignment.

The website consists of three main pages. The index.html page allows users to search and select a dog breed from a dropdown and view a random image of the selected breed. The gallery.html page displays a grid of 9 random images for a selected breed. The about.html page explains the purpose of the project and includes a button to view a completely random dog image.

All pages share a consistent design with a soothing blue gradient background and responsive layout. The style is defined in the style.css file, which is reused across all three HTML pages. JavaScript functionality for index.html and gallery.html is handled in separate files: js/index.js and js/gallery.js respectively.

To test the site locally, you can either double-click the HTML files to open them in a browser or use a simple Python HTTP server to run the project from a local server. This ensures all API requests work correctly in your browser.

Once the site is tested and confirmed to work, it can be deployed to GitHub Pages by enabling GitHub Pages from the repository settings and selecting the root of the main branch as the source.

The project was created entirely with vanilla JavaScript and uses no frameworks. The Dog CEO API was used to fetch breed lists and images. This project is open for educational use and all dog images are sourced from the public Dog CEO API.
